# Predictive Analysis of IT Helpdesk Ticket Resolution Time

## Project Overview
"This project develops a machine learning model to predict the resolution time of IT helpdesk tickets. Employing advanced NLP techniques for text summarization and sentiment analysis, we extract meaningful features from ticket descriptions to enrich our predictive modeling. By analyzing historical data along with these dynamically generated NLP features, we aim to improve resource allocation, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. The project represents a practical application of data science, coupled with NLP, to enhance IT helpdesk operations, driven by insights from Kaggle's comprehensive dataset."

## Data Source
The data used in this project is sourced from the IT Helpdesk Dataset available on Kaggle, which contains a rich history of IT helpdesk tickets.

## Steps Involved

### Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**: Tackle missing values, outliers, and anomalies.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create features like 'ResolutionDurationMins', 'DayOfWeekOpened', and 'TimeOfDayOpened'.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Process categorical columns for the model.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Use Plotly for visual analytics.
- Conduct a correlation study between features and resolution times.

## Model Insights

- **R² Score**: The model shows a strong capability in predicting resolution times, as indicated by the R² score.
- **MSE and MAE**: The high values of MSE and MAE suggest the presence of large errors in certain predictions, potentially caused by outliers or violations of the model's assumptions.

### Recommendations

- **Reviewing Outliers**: It's essential to revisit outliers within the dataset since they significantly affect the MSE. We should consider implementing strategies to handle outliers or refine our feature engineering techniques.
- **Feature Importance**: Analysis reveals that 'TimeOfDayOpened' is a critical predictor, heavily influencing resolution times. In contrast, 'KYC' seems to have a negligible effect. This finding encourages us to scrutinize the data collection and feature engineering processes, particularly around the timing of issue reporting.

### Conclusions

The performance of the model is commendable with regard to the R² score; however, we acknowledge the necessity for improvement in reducing prediction errors, as shown by MSE and MAE. Addressing the issues surrounding outliers and focusing on significant features can potentially lead to a more refined and accurate model.
