# Predictive Analysis of IT Helpdesk Ticket Resolution Time

## Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict the resolution time of IT helpdesk tickets. By analyzing historical data and ticket attributes, we aim to improve resource allocation, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.

## Data Source
The data used in this project is sourced from the IT Helpdesk Dataset available on Kaggle, which contains a rich history of IT helpdesk tickets.

## Steps Involved

### Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**: Tackle missing values, outliers, and anomalies.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create features like 'ResolutionDurationMins', 'DayOfWeekOpened', and 'TimeOfDayOpened'.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Process categorical columns for the model.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Use Plotly for visual analytics.
- Conduct a correlation study between features and resolution times.

### Feature Selection
- Select significant features based on their correlation with the target variable.

### Model Development
- Experiment with various algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

### Model Evaluation
- Use metrics like RMSE, MSE, MAE, and RÂ² to evaluate model performance.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Fine-tune the Gradient Boosting Regressor with GridSearchCV.

### Final Model Training and Prediction
- Train the final model with the best parameters.
- Predict and evaluate the performance on the test set.

### Deployment Strategy
- Integrate the model into the existing IT system.
- Provide an interface for the helpdesk team.

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- Keep track of model performance.
- Regularly update the model with new data.

### Documentation and Reporting
- Maintain thorough documentation of methods, code, and outcomes.
- Prepare detailed reports and presentations.

## Key Considerations
- **Data Privacy**: Comply with data protection regulations.
- **Model Explainability**: Ensure the model's decisions can be understood.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Prioritize efficiency for real-time predictions.

This project represents a practical application of data science to enhance IT helpdesk operations, driven by insights from Kaggle's dataset.
