# Predictive Analysis of IT Helpdesk Ticket Resolution Time

## Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict the resolution time of IT helpdesk tickets. By analyzing historical data and ticket attributes, we aim to improve resource allocation, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency.

## Data Source
The data used in this project is sourced from the IT Helpdesk Dataset available on Kaggle, which contains a rich history of IT helpdesk tickets.

## Steps Involved

### Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**: Tackle missing values, outliers, and anomalies.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create features like 'ResolutionDurationMins', 'DayOfWeekOpened', and 'TimeOfDayOpened'.
- **Categorical Encoding**: Process categorical columns for the model.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Use Plotly for visual analytics.
- Conduct a correlation study between features and resolution times.

### Feature Selection
- Select significant features based on their correlation with the target variable.

### Model Development
- Experiment with various algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

### Model Evaluation
- Use metrics like RMSE, MSE, MAE, and R² to evaluate model performance.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Fine-tune the Gradient Boosting Regressor with GridSearchCV.

### Final Model Training and Prediction
- Train the final model with the best parameters.
- Predict and evaluate the performance on the test set.

### Deployment Strategy
- Integrate the model into the existing IT system.
- Provide an interface for the helpdesk team.

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- Keep track of model performance.
- Regularly update the model with new data.

### Documentation and Reporting
- Maintain thorough documentation of methods, code, and outcomes.
- Prepare detailed reports and presentations.

## Key Considerations
- **Data Privacy**: Comply with data protection regulations.
- **Model Explainability**: Ensure the model's decisions can be understood.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Prioritize efficiency for real-time predictions.

## Model Insights

- **R² Score**: The model shows a strong capability in predicting resolution times, as indicated by the R² score.
- **MSE and MAE**: The high values of MSE and MAE suggest the presence of large errors in certain predictions, potentially caused by outliers or violations of the model's assumptions.

### Recommendations

- **Reviewing Outliers**: It's essential to revisit outliers within the dataset since they significantly affect the MSE. We should consider implementing strategies to handle outliers or refine our feature engineering techniques.
- **Feature Importance**: Analysis reveals that 'TimeOfDayOpened' is a critical predictor, heavily influencing resolution times. In contrast, 'KYC' seems to have a negligible effect. This finding encourages us to scrutinize the data collection and feature engineering processes, particularly around the timing of issue reporting.

### Conclusions

The performance of the model is commendable with regard to the R² score; however, we acknowledge the necessity for improvement in reducing prediction errors, as shown by MSE and MAE. Addressing the issues surrounding outliers and focusing on significant features can potentially lead to a more refined and accurate model.
